# Time-Series Analysis using Keras
This repository provides examples of CNN (Convolutional neural network) implementations in Keras for 1d time-series analysis. For each example, there is a readme file on proper ways to use and reference data, a python file to generate data (if not already available), and a jupyter notebook for implementing the CNN model in Keras.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or see any problems, please do write an issue. Thanks!
